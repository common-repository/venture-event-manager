*We take you <em>beyond</em> the limitations of traditional recurring events. In fact, this is part of what makes Venture Event Manager so special.

Unlike other event management plugins, VEM provides true flexibility when creating multiple occurrences of the same event.

<em>Forget about a complicated set of recurrence rules or cranking out multiple copies of the same event for each occurence.</em>

VEM goes beyond limited recurrence rules and delivers true freeform <strong>multi-occurrence</strong> control. Simply put, you can create any number of occurrences per event, each with any combination of the following values:
<ul>
 	<li>Venue</li>
 	<li>Date, Start and End times</li>
 	<li>Free form text note</li>
 	<li>First ticket button/link: price (to/from), button text, and URL</li>
 	<li>Second ticket button/link: price (to/from), button text, and URL</li>
</ul>
VEM is designed to drastically reduce time entering and managing your event information so you can focus on being creative and promoting your events.

<em><strong>Of course</strong></em> it should be this easy!
